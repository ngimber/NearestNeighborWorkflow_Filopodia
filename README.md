# NearestNeighborWorkflow_Filopodia

This Jupyter Notebook was used to calculate Nearest Neighbor Distances from hand-annotated Filopodia lists to PRG2 spots within the same neuron and controls, by randomly placing thespots within a neuronal binary mask. 

Instructions
-------

Prerequisites are: 
- List of Filopodia Coordinates (tab delimited columns: Name	X	Y	Channel	Frame), coordinates as Âµm
- List of PRG2 spots (tab delimited columns: Name	X	Y	Frame)
- binary masks (tif format, black background)  


Further information is provided in the methods section of Brosig and Fuchs et al. 2019.
