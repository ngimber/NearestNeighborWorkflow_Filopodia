This Jupyter Notebook was used to calculate Nearest Neighbor Distances from hand-annotated Filopodia lists to PRG2 spots within the same neuron and controls, by randomly placing thespots within a neuronal binary mask. Prerequisites are: 
- List of Filopodia Coordinates
- List of PRG2 spots
- binary masks (tif format)
